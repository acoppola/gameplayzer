# Gameplayzer

For those u don't know gameplayzer is a tool that take your database, analyze it and tweak some values in order to get a better gameplay.
This time i've reached the goal to make players style behaviour codes (as cut passing lanes, man marking, free roam, come back ondefense, join the attack, cut inside, drift wide etc etc) available so the cpu will take an upgrade on their AI, and i've tweaked the player style to get the best experience.


### Requisites
You need:
* Python 2.7
* PyQT 4
* IDLE editor (that comes in Python 2.7)
* some knowledgeof Python

### Development
 I'll put up some docs , meanwhile check the code.
 Is a bit messy, you know, i started it to learn python some years ago. I wish for free time to improve the code with the standards of good coding practice, but i don't have that time right now.
